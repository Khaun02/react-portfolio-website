            <p className="m-4">I have been engaged in professional Web Development for 1 year now. I create Full-Stack websites with a minimalist look and speed. I also focus on website accessibility, website optimization and SEO.</p>
            <p className="m-4">I like minimalism. I stand by the fact that the website should not be full of ads and trackers. I also use React sometimes.</p>
            <p className="m-4">I also create problem-solving applications. Check out my Projects to see some software I've created.</p>
