            <p>I have been engaged in professional Web Development for several years. I create Full-Stack websites with a minimalist look and speed. I also focus on website accessibility, website optimization and SEO.</p>
            <p>I like minimalism. I stand by the fact that the website should not be full of ads and trackers and completely useless JavaScript. On the other hand, I understand that sometimes a complex website hard to do without a lot of JavaScript. I also use React sometimes.</p>
            <p>But I stand by the fact that it is possible to make a good website even without JavaScript. For example this one. This site is completely JavaScript-free. (except for Cloudflare email protection, so you wonâ€™t see my email without JS)</p>
